#BigDecimalFunctions
Mathematical functions needed for BigDecimal. Tried and tested!

`BigDecimal` class is a boon for developers asking for accurate numerical calculations. But the biggest drawback is its lack of supported mathematical functions. Whatever function that is available uses `double` internally. Now, what use is using `BigDecimal` if mathematical operations are done in `double`. So, here is a library full of functions that can be used with `BigDecimal`. And yes, they all work as `BigDecimal` internally.

##Included Mathematical Functions
###`exp()`
Used to calculate numbers raised to the power of `e`.
###`ln()`
Used to calculate the natural logarithm numbers.
###`pow()`
Used to calculate numbers raised to the power of other numbers.
###`root()`
Used to calculate the n<sup>th</sup> root of numbers.
###`sin()`
Used to calculate the sine of some angle.
###`sqrt()`
Used to calculate the square root of numbers.
##Other Miscellaneous Functions
###`getFraction()`
Used to get the fraction part of a number.
###`getWhole()`
Used to get the whole part of a number.
